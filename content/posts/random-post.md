#### Story Time: A budding CS geek is born
I actually made my first website way back when at the age of ~10 to create a website inspired half by neopets and half by certain tv shows I was watching at the time (S/O Sailor Moon and Fruits Basket). There wasn't much for website building back then but I used this website called Yolasite (iykyk) to host my website and spent a lot of time playing around with the HTML and styling to get my website to have a purple glittery background and have hamster cartoons everywhere.

Fast forwarding to this summer- I had an amazing opportunity to develop my front end skills as a software engineer as an intern on Google Sheets. I had sort of an "aha" moment this summer when I started applying my newfound front end skills to playing around with my own website development and I realized... I am such a _dork_. I was spending my free time **outside** of my coding internship also coding, and it was pleasantly surprised to understand that I truly enjoy the career path I have chosen for myself and genuinely am having fun with it!
