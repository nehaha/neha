### WELCOME to my first blog!!!

HELLO! My name is Neha and I have no business starting this blog _but_ I set a goal for myself to feel more comfortable writing this year and want to use this platform to document the random things I deep dive and learn about. 

#### A little bit about me..
<!--more--> I'm an undergrad student pursuing a double degree in CS and finance, and am SUPER into learning about either of these topics (seriously, hmu if you ever want to talk about the power of compounding interest). That aside, I really do have a wide variety of everchanging interests. As I write this post, that includes:

- **FOOD**. 
	- I am a **huge** foodie and have lived in a couple big food spots in the U.S that I am excited to share my experiences about
- **Reading**
	- I have a _thing_ for memoirs/autobiographies but I will read anything and everything except scary thriller books. Feel free to check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57467394-neha-satapathy) to see what I'm currently reading!
- **Music** 
	- I compose music on the piano from time to time and recently started learning guitar
- **Playing random games on my Nintendo Switch** that I impulsively bought at the start of quarantine to play Animal Crossing. 
- **Real estate** and in general, **financial literacy**
- Last but not least, **TECH**!!! 
	- This sounds v cheesy but I love that we live in a time of such insane technological development and I ~**l o v e**~ learning about innovative tools and products that makes life easier. 
	- I am actually using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and some of my own front-end knowledge to develop this website myself, which has been an exciting and rewarding endeavor so far(:

This entire website/blog has mostly been a result of COVID quarantine cabin fever, but also a desire to build something. Staying on brand with myself in having way more interests than I know what to do with, this website will probably have a hard time keeping focus on one particular topic. Feel free to join me on this _adventure_ as I explore my interests in tech, finance, and beyond!
