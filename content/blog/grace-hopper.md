Having attended GHC twice (once as a student actively recruiting and once as a professional looking to network and learn more about tech x female empowerment), I have developed a good understanding of what is out there for conference attendees, and have summarized my findings and thoughts on the conference for you in this post!

## Why you should go


## Getting your hands on a ticket
The most ideal way of attending Grace Hopper is to have your entire trip paid for. Now, I know what you're thinking- 'Neha, that's CRAZY!' But LET ME TELL YOU, I have many friends who have attended GHC multiple years in a row having not paid a single cent for travel or lodging. It is **more common than you would think**.  

By the time I found out about GHC's magical existence, the deadline for most scholarships had already passed and the only option left was to buy a ticket myself. For those of you who are lucky enough to have avoided this position and/or don't know, conference tickets are generally ~$550 for students and ~$1000 for industry professionals. What's worse, tickets for this conference are (understandably) in such high demand, the high influx of people trying to access the registration page usually causes it to crash within minutes of opening, and tickets sell out within an hour of opening. This is probably not conducive to fixing the actual problem of the server crashing (oops), but I recommend if you're trying to buy a ticket that you have multiple browsers open so that you increase the chance of one of them going through. Additionally, sometimes people link shortcuts that somehow bypass the waiting queue and directly take you to registration on Twitter and Facebook, so it's good to keep an eye out for that by searching for hashtags with #GHC or #GraceHopper.
