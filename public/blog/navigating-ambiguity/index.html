<meta property="og:description" content="I had my first existential crisis at the age of 20.
Leading up to it, I had gone through a lot of loss and changes in my life, ranging from moving to NYC for a summer to losing a close friend.
I saw it coming, so I felt like I had more time to prepare&hellip; but honestly, nothing really prepares you for the depressing void that opens up a few months after you graduate and start thinking about what you&rsquo;re really doing. COVID and quarantine has probably exacerbated this for my class of 2020 folks, but it seems to be a surpringly common issue that people silently go through.
What do you do with yourself after graduating college and leaving a life of structure??
Many people choose to continue their life of structure, either by pursuing more education in grad school or by blindly climbing the corporate ladder, working towards each promotion. While I don&rsquo;t find these options to be bad options necessarily, I think its important to make the distinction of why you do what you&rsquo;re doing.
My answer to navigating the ambiguity that lurks in the shadows of any new grad is actually more spiritual and big picture than I initially realized.
One particular event in my life that I want to dive into today was my first corporate experience: my first ever Software Engineering internship! Having jumped up and down
was I started to ask myself questions I took for granted growing up. Questions about death, the meaning of life, and what the hell I was doing Having the nagging feeling to constantly be productive, I had plenty of free time at the start of quarantine to panic about how I should make the most of my time.
In some cases, reality does meet our expectations, but we soon realize that we don&rsquo;t want what we thought we wanted.
So what do you do when you graduate from a structured life in school and are now left?
At first thought, being in control of your life sounds daunting.

<p>Having danced around my kitchen in excitement after finding out I had an offer to intern in NYC for the summer 8 months prior, my everyday routine in the summer of 2018 included grudgingly getting out of bed and taking a train to Jersey City to stare at a crusty computer screen for 9 hours. Afterwards, I would return back to my apartment, watch tv, sleep, and repeat. My first corporate experience was boring, repetitive, and exhausting - nowhere near as glamorous as what working in New York should have been.</p>
<p>With the power of hindsight, I now realize that some aspect of what I was going through is what many new grads experience after graduating from college. After spending our entire lives looking forward to the freedom that we think is adulthood, we&rsquo;re faced with the uncomfortable reality of our expectations not matching reality. Or rather, our reality catches up to our goals. For some, this happens with our jobs: days turn into months as we painfully smile our way through corporate meetings. For others, this might manifest at home, when you&rsquo;re left alone with your thoughts at night, asking yourself &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Having dealt with plenty of unmet expectations and existential dread in the past few years, I&rsquo;ve recognized a few themes in navigating ambiguous times in my life, and hope you might find this applicable :)</p>
<h1 id="process--outcome">Process &gt; Outcome</h1>
<p>As any business book will emphasize, success is not a goal, but rather a system. It is a system that you build for yourself, comprised of smaller habits that are conducive to clearing your mind, improving your productivity, and essentially setting yourself up for growth.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the career applications of this, the idea of focusing on the process resonates with me even on a more spiritual level. Having spent a lot of time thinking about my time on Earth and how our time here is limited, I realize that while having lifetime goals of maybe saving money to buy a house, becoming an executive at a well-respected company, or even just travelling are good to have, if we put enjoying our lives on pause until these events happen, we are more likely to live a much more dull life. The cliche &ldquo;if I die tomorrow would I die with regrets?&rdquo; mindset is applicable to this.</p>
<p>Bringing this back to our poor new grad, who is realizing that their next goals are a lot more lofty and less structured than previous ones, I think its important to nourish a shift in mindset from relying on others to provide structure to creating a system for ourselves, on our own terms.</p>
<h1 id="balancing-is-a-btch">Balancing is a B*tch!</h1>
<p>Adolescent Neha got a taste of this in high school when she signed up for literally every extracurricular club offered. In today&rsquo;s day and age, it is so easy to burn out trying to pursue &ldquo;self development&rdquo; activities. With the added pressures of social media showing us every thing that others are doing, feeling the need to get extra certifications, pursue more projects, and just be a bigger person can be overwhelming. Recognizing the necessity of learning to breathe and make time for yourself (and I truly mean YOURSELF) is much easier said than done, but nonetheless really important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll save my thoughts on the levels of education for another letter, but the most important step in my mind is first internalizing the importance of nourishing yourself. Understanding and reflecting on how your physical and mental wellbeing affects all parts of your life will influence your priorities.</p>
